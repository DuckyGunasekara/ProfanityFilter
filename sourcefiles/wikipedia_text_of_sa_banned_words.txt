== Afrikanerisms ==

This list of "Afrikanerisms" comprises slang words and phrases influenced by [[Afrikaans]] and other African languages. Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal [[South African English]]. Note when the letter "g" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Note, words ending in "-ng" are pronounced identical to those in English. Note, in most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the "d" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the "n" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; "tooth"), formal = "tande", informal = "tanne". In singular words' syllables ending in "-d", "-nd" and "-heid", the "d" is always pronounced as a "t". For example: "ge-son(t)-hei(t)" (gesondheid, "health"). Note, the English term ''slang'' is used strictly in its English pronunciation in context, as the Afrikaans word of the same spelling (though pronounced as "slung") translates as "snake".

Fanakalo ([[fanagalo]]) also refers to when people of non-Zulu origin attempt to speak Zulu without the proper pronunciation and throat sounds.
''Fanakalo'' in Zulu literally means "same as this" – (fana – same, ka – as, lo – this).

You could say, "Hey ''bro'' , ''howzit''" or "Thanks a million ''bro'' for lending me your car". When you refer to another male as ''bro'' is it because you consider that person to be such a good friend he is like a brother, a family member. ''Bro'' can also be used for strangers but only also if you wish to show a welcoming and friendly attitude towards them or when you want to deescalate tension in a friendly way as in "Chill out ''bro''". However you would certainly not walk around calling every man you see, ''bro'', because in South Africa the term is not used as loosely as it is in the USA for example.
